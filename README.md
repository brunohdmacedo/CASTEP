# CASTEP
Little programs that help with data manipulation of files in the CASTEP density functional theory code.

Objectives: 1) Speed up the slowest parts of post-processing DFT outputs
            2) Maintain and improve old scripts for manipulating data
            3) Automate ourselves out of a job
